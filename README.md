# Persist

A modern Anki flashcard application built with Swift and Python.

## Features

I used to be a frequent Quizlet user, but I grew tired of how cumbersome it was to add to and enhance my flashcards. This app offers several improvements that make it more suitable for everyday use:

- üìù Easy editing and modification of flashcards
- üè∑Ô∏è Tag-based organization (where one card can appear in multiple sets)
- üìä Streak and incorrect/correct ratio tracking and sorting
- üîî macOS notifications to nudge behavior
- üñºÔ∏è Image support
- ‚å®  Keyboard shortcuts

## Prerequisites

- macOS 12.0 or later
- Xcode 14.0 or later (for development)
- Python 3.8 or later

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ntlind/persist.git
   cd persist
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # For production
   make install

   # For development (includes pre-commit hooks)
   make install-dev
   ```

    Running `make install-dev` will install pre-commit hooks that:
    - Format Python code with Black
    - Lint Python code with Flake8
    - Check for common issues (trailing whitespace, merge conflicts, etc.)


## Running the App

### Development

Run the backend server:
```bash
make run-dev
```

On your first run, you need to initialize the database:
```bash
make db-init
```

Open the frontend in Xcode:
```bash
make xcode
# or make build-frontend
```

Run tests:
```bash
make test
```

### Building and Debugging

Clean build artifacts:
```bash
make clean
```

Create application bundle:
```bash
make bundle
```

Once bundled, you can run the app from the Finder:
```bash
open dist/Persist.app
```

Debug distribution:
```bash
make debug-dist
```
